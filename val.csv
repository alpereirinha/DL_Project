2014,Don't,Ed Sheeran,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows

2021,Gone,Dierks Bentley,"My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left
I've been gone, I've been gone

Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room

A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is
Come around
And now I'm ruined, yeah
I'm ruined
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me

I should have never let you leave

2015,Little Toy Guns,Carrie Underwood,"In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of the faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
She's saying, she's praying.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done

Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept, Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
42 millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out, ""YOLO, "" yeah, that's still the motto

And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves
No matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
I'd Be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait till tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have 'em take their time
When they lay this sinner down
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Gonna get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain't a player, I just (Player, I just...)
You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you""
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you're here
They don't deserve you

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

A house and everything in between

I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You shine them when I'm alone

And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Touch my own skin and hope they'll still be there

Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to skrrting out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name

Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth

But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home bringing the sad
Soon as these happy faces, you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown, pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax
Welcome to my house
Baby take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house

But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna to let you know what the fuck that I've been through
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes, three jobs took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say, but don't know shit 'bout where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub just to make it past where I am from
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
(Sixteen in the middle of Miami)
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work, work, work, work

I've been work, work, work, work
Workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that pac shit
My passion was ironic and my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind basically raped me
Ran through the bull shit like a Matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em and even the score
So, I went harder, studied the Carters 'til a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording at 4 in the morn'n
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant Art Ignorant
Your ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate be inconsiderate but the industry took my innocence
Too late now I'm in this bitch
You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley Girls giving blow jobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami

Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy, but cheers to Peezy
For the weeks we lived out of duffle, bags is all we had
Do anything, for my Mum I love you
One day I'll pay you back, for the sacrifice that you managed to muscle
16 you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need, 'cause it's all that I ever had

2014,I Got A Car,George Strait,"She was leanin' on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinkin' that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over
And ok, so now what
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothin'
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, what do you think all this is goin'
I said, there ain't no way of knowin'
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'

I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, what do you think all this is goin'
I said, there ain't no way of knowin'
I really hadn't thought it through that far
And I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stoppin' place
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday mornin', rain pourin' down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's somethin'
You think it'll start, I said, it's already runnin'
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'?

2018,Get Along,Kenny Chesney,"Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, said, ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said, ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long, long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered, was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long, long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along
We find out when you die, the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got
To get along
Down the road
We've got a long, long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can

Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny

Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""Hey, baby!""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies

If you ask me, I'm killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, enter in line between the beauty and a beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind

Oh here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you're upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy

Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is ""Snapped"" (""Snapped"", ""Snapped"")

Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch

2018,Everything's Gonna Be Alright,David Lee Murphy & Kenny Chesney,"She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said ""yes m'am"", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low
And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright
So I nodded my head and said, ""that's for sure""
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea
And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la

2012,Give Your Heart A Break,Demi Lovato,"The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
Now here we are
So close yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh, yeah, yeah
On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply
The world is ours
If we want it, we can take it
If you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh, yeah, yeah
When your lips are on my lips
And our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run
Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh
Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break (Let me give your heart)
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

This is forever

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you
I'll admit it, all be it pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty, do not sit with me well
It's not your fault they try get me, cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more I'm wrong
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you
I'll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move Ons
And dark, good nigga troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you

Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hunnid questions
I can't fuck with you no more 'cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where your bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dawg
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dawg
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dawg
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dawg
Oh, and I'm back, dawg
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dawg
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that he don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, and now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dawg
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dawg
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dawg
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still
