2015,Fight Song,Rachel Platten,"Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain

2022,Something In The Orange,Zach Bryan,"It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again

2013,Beat This Summer,Brad Paisley,"Like the first wheel goes around and around
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
Before you know it it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
You won't find a tan line anywhere
Baby I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end...
As long I live, whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
Yeah looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby I can tell
As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you

2021,Enough For You,Olivia Rodrigo,"I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave
You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back
Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough

2015,Coffee,Miguel,"I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night
I wish I could paint our love

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope-nope, y'all can't copy
Yeah, bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said...
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Snap my psyche like a twig
And I just wanna see if you feel the same as me

Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive

Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air

A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin'
There's water in my boat

Tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke
The prescriptions on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""
Damn
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking damn shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying God don't let me bust quick
I'm watching pornos tryin' see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle""
'Cause
'Cause I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

Achooo
That was a blessing
She special to you
I don't look at her special
Actually I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above we do all the etcetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular

Passing thru Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black
Shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trap

My section ridiculous
Watch where you stepping
Pockets on envy, you can't be to careful

When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnecting her cellular
What you need that for undressing
What you need that for caressing her
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back
Go to pressing her
Trying to see who tap first made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings she say we inseparable

It's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front do it make me a elephant

I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soul
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on the blender 'fore you burn somÐµ
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't gÐµt it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA, always keep it a hunnid K
Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect

Everybody knew they could find me there
Then right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere
Sitting over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little 'Shook Me All Night Long'

I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for
Sitting over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little 'Shook Me All Night Long'

Workin' like a dog all day ain't workin' for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And I was sittin' on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says money can't buy happiness
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say, money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars

And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle

But it still sounds pretty cool

It could buy me a truck to pull it

2016,Record Year,Eric Church,"Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk outta here
I've been havin' a record year
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

We were singin' every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was fallin' fast, we was jumpin' in
Blue jean halo hangin' off the wind
Two American kids just like them
Every time we play
It blew us away
Do you turn it up, do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Like we did then, like we did when
Do you close your eyes, does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
To 6 packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played
Yeah we were never growin' up or growin' old
Breakin' up or lettin' go
Girl just like rock 'n' roll, where's it gone
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holdin' on to sixteen long as you can
Every time that it comes on
Do you turn it up, do you sing along
Every time you hear that song

Tried to play it cool but I knew already
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights
It was gonna be one of those nights
Got the Kenwoods banging that rock n' roll
Whisper to me baby where you wanna go
I can ride you 'round town or drive you down some ol' back road
I love the way you lean that seat back, steal my ball cap
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watchin' your hair fly out the window
Just lettin' the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes
We can run the reds down Main Street dodging the blue lights
Or disappear off into the corn out past the county line
Baby keep on keep on swaying to the backbeat
Long as you're right here right here beside me
You make the call baby I don't care
We can take this anywhere

Man in real life, sugar gyal dem haffi get wopped (Yeah)
Know she want dark, told her ""Meet me at the top""
Switching lanes the other day, I seen her waiting for a bus
Baby this a Moncler sweater, Diesel denim
Buy another when my pockets fat like Heather
Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind
She make it clap like I'm Busta Rhymes

New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my straps, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupÃ©, that's a head loss
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mom while you twiddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong

See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up

And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you

2020,God Whispered Your Name,Keith Urban,"I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, mm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name
It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain (out of the rain)
And talk about being saved
Oh, suddenly I wanna live

2012,Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye Featuring Kimbra,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
But you didn't have to cut me off

Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
And I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down

'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bopping up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down
Here
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got

2016,Church Bells,Carrie Underwood,"Jenny grew up wild, like a Blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a Bluetick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest
It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir's singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptists
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law-man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing",2015,"R&B/Soul, Hip-Hop/Rap",jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy out in the shack with a bluetick hound broke as hell but blessed with beauty the kind that a rich man cant turn down she caught the eye of an oil man dancing one summer night in a dime store dress she had the looks he had the mansion and you can figure out the rest it was all roses dripping in diamonds sipping on champagne she was all uptown wearing that white gown taking his last name she could hear those church bells ringing ringing and up in the loft that whole choirs singing singing fold your hands and close your eyes yeah its all gonna be alright and just listen to the church bells ringing ringing yeah theyre ringing jenny was hosting junior league parties and having dinner at the country club everyone thought they were ken and barbie but ken was always getting way too drunk saturday night after a few too many he came home ready to fight and all his money could never save jenny from the devil living in his eyes it was all bruises covered in makeup dark sunglasses and that next morning sitting in the back pew praying with the baptists she could hear those church bells ringing ringing and up in the loft that whole choir singing singing fold your hands and close your eyes yeah its all gonna be alright you just listen to the church bells ringing ringing yeah theyre ringing jenny slipped something in his tennessee whiskey no lawman was ever gonna find and how he died is still a mystery but he hit a woman for the very last time she could hear those church bells ringing ringing standing there in a black dress singing singing fold your hands and close your eyes yeah its all gonna be alright and just listen to the church bells ringing ringing yeah theyre ringing,jenny grew wild like blackfoot daisy shack bluetick hound broke hell blessed beauty kind rich man turn caught eye oil man dancing one summer night dime store dress looks mansion figure rest roses dripping diamonds sipping champagne uptown wearing white gown taking last name could hear church bells ringing ringing loft whole choirs singing singing fold hands close eyes alright listen church bells ringing ringing theyre ringing jenny hosting junior league parties dinner country club everyone thought ken barbie ken always getting way drunk saturday night many came home ready fight money could never save jenny devil living eyes bruises covered makeup dark sunglasses next morning sitting back pew praying baptists could hear church bells ringing ringing loft whole choir singing singing fold hands close eyes alright listen church bells ringing ringing theyre ringing jenny slipped something tennessee whiskey lawman ever find died still mystery hit woman last time could hear church bells ringing ringing standing black dress singing singing fold hands close eyes alright listen church bells ringing ringing theyre ringing,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.735, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9431}",0.9431,Positive

Ya know even if our ship came in
And this is all we got
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht...'
Cause
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way
To the river bank
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I'd go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we'd tell our bosses they can do the same
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But 'til that dream comes true, why don't ya grab your bikini...
'Cause
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way
To the river bank
However it goes (whatever happens)
We've got it made (in these shades)
'Cause, baby, we can float (behind this boat)
And we can ride a wave
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day, we're laughing all the way

2013,Cruise,Florida Georgia Line Featuring Nelly,"Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My leather black jeans on

Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans

I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)

Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

2019,The Ones That Didn't Make It Back Home,Justin Moore,"Tour was up, middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, Grandma's recipe
There was a knock on her door 'round two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree
Blowing in the breeze
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones, the wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
They're in a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin' the ones
The ones that didn't make it back home
The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slideshow of
His twenty-two years
There was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half price that night
And everybody raised 'em high, singin'
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones, the wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
They're in a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin' the ones
The ones that didn't make it back home
Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones, the wish they were here ones

I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning?
I thought that I was what you wanted
Well, I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
I hope you find what you were looking for

2017,Shape Of You,Ed Sheeran,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil' homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok, now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along, man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right

Me, I'm just dunnin' the hype
Me, I'm just dunnin' the hype

6 cold like Alaska, Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA, bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feelin' a way and won't hide it
Niggas done bein' silent
Don't get along, man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually

2019,Happier,Marshmello & Bastille,"Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with the all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, that's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute

2014,Not A Bad Thing,Justin Timberlake,"Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
No I won't fill your mind with broken promises
And wasted time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free

2021,We Didn't Have Much,Justin Moore,"Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes
Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo
Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole
Don't get no dirt on your church clothes
Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves
Ten percent in the offering plate
Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race
Sure'd be nice to get back to that place
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And had a little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
Eighteen, left it all behind
Chasing a girl, chasing a dime
Went so far tryna get mine
I can't see that old porch light
That led me home at night
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And had a little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
When we didn't have much
I can still hear grandma readin'
That red letter Book of John
I can still smell coffee in the kitchen
Ol' Don Williams on
And there was dirt on daddy's clothes

To get paid, to get the girl

2014,Let It Go,Idina Menzel,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on

I know it's all in my head

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead

Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix

In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted

Made 'em shit, he a bitch

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me
But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you

And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eye' closed
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You use plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!
I never fear death or dyin'
I only fear never tryin'
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
Ayy, I'm not to be played with
Because it could get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with, if you're looking for me
You could find Wiz in the new car or the crowd
With my new broad, that's a fine chick
And no other squad I'm down with, ain't (no way around it)
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball

It's the day in the life, and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feeling like a killer inside

Ridin' with the plugs, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl (than her outfit)
Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam, and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who tryin' to say somethin'
One thing about it, got a problem? I got the same one
Money rose, we fold
Playin' in clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs

2012,Some Nights,fun.,"Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh-oh
what do I stand for?
(Whoa ooh whoa, oh) what do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore
Oh oh, oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh, oh-oh
Oh oh, oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh, oh-oh
So this is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
But some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh-oh
what do I stand for?
(Whoa ooh whoa, oh) what do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know
so this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
No, when I see stars, when I seeâ
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs
They sound like a swan, so come on
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
Well, this is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible lies
Oh oh, oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh, oh-oh
Oh oh, oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh, oh-oh
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen

2014,Wake Me Up!,Avicii,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

Glass on the side up
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So, maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know

I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady
I need you darling

I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change
Singing we found love in a local raid, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said it's nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep
If anybody finds out, I'm meant to drive home
But I'm drunk and gonna live it now, no?
We just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissing my mouth

This mint green is new for spring

You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're runnin' from

For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You should've kept my undershirt

And none of them know what they're runnin' from

My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back

2019,Some Of It,Eric Church,"Beer don't keep, love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink, daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't wishin' well
Money ain't rich, everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong gets right
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to
Some of it
Girls like to laugh, tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta pass
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Till the breaks go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No you don't get to do some things again
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't prob'ly know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to
Some of it
When you can't take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
The rhythm makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use

Accusations everyday she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored he's on his own time
Shoulda' ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her tryna' flip it
Back on her like a victim

Now she's got baggage on her shoulder

He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten' up since
Every now and then she goes off though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survery
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call a hoe after hang ups
Gives her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted
She's fallin' in love now

2016,The Sound Of Silence,Disturbed,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the sign said, ""The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
In tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",2015,"Metal, Orchestral pop",hello darkness my old friend ive come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while i was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never shared and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming then the sign said the words on the prophets are written on the subway walls in tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence,hello darkness old friend come talk vision softly creeping left seeds sleeping vision planted brain still remains within sound silence restless dreams walked alone narrow streets cobblestone neath halo street lamp turned collar cold damp eyes stabbed flash neon light split night touched sound silence naked light saw ten thousand people maybe people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs voices never shared one dared disturb sound silence fools said silence like cancer grows hear words might teach take arms might reach words like silent raindrops fell echoed wells silence people bowed prayed neon god made sign flashed warning words forming sign said words prophets written subway walls tenement halls whispered sound silence,"{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.683, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': -0.6636}",-0.6636,Negative

2013,Little Bit Of Everything,Keith Urban,"I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it'd be good for me
I want a cool chick that'll cook for me
But'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want and she'll do it with me
I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
Now I don't need a garage full of cars
But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I'll smoke 'em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don't need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ole room
Still feels lonely when it's just you
Yes it does
I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
I'll be OK with what I've done
Still having fun
'Cause I don't need too much of nothing

2018,One Number Away,Luke Combs,"Are you sitting at home all alone
Trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone
Praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen
A thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer
Getting lost in your favorite lines?
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a
Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror
Get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station
Replacing our favorite song?
Well, maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""

Nobody's gonna get hurt, so whats the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmers field

On that drop tailgate, on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout a beer, sittin' on ice

In that farmers field, will make a boy a man

Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that truck
That got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning 'bout right by doing it wrong
Hoping we didn't get caught
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you're lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place, she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues 'bout
Spending what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you're lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant

You don't wanna hear about my last break up
I don't wanna worry 'bout space you take up
I don't even care if you're here when I wake up
It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
I don't want a number, you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
Well, I ain't Cinderella, but who is?
Call me what you want if the shoe fits
I ain't gonna say I never do this, 'cause truth is
Lonely makes a heart ruthless
Ain't nobody gonna hurt nobody
Ain't nothing wrong with needing somebody
You can leave all that

Can't you just use me like I'm using you?

It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June

You say ""No way"", then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my
T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns N' Roses video
Ooh ooh so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like, your dress, my floor, the way you wore
My my T-Shirt
Yeah, you look good in my T-shirt girl

2012,Springsteen,Eric Church,"To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
""Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh""
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear ""Born in the USA""
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?

Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset

I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'

But you're taking shots at me like it's PatrÃ³n
And I'm just like ""Damn, it's 7:00 a.m.""
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson that stressin'
And obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones so
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)

Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign, must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours

Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself
I don't want it even though I do
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again

Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me

2012,Set Fire To The Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing gets better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time

2012,(Kissed You) Good Night,Gloriana,"I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasnât scared at all
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Iâve kissed you
Itâs a good night good night baby goodnight
You couldnât see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldnât go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall
So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Iâve kissed you
Itâs a good night good night baby goodnight
I turned off the car
ran through the yard
back to your front door
Half scared to death canât catch my breath
Arenât these the moments we live for
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that Iâve kissed you

(Oh)
Bartender looked at me like, ""Pony up man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
Ended up down the rabbit hole again
Funny how you haven't changed a bit but you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go but somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself that maybe you called when I was out
And you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you've been up to lately
Or who you've been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go but somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Modern love leads to modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation
And I 'bout had enough watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go but somethin' always reminds me

2013,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3, 500 hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us, whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (Not crying on Sundays)

2014,Play It Again,Luke Bryan,"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
I'd a gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

But here she is free right next to me

2017,Do I Make You Wanna,Billy Currington,"Baby what's on your mind?
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can get lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl, when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light
Go to Vegas, stay up all night
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little seven, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show?
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go

Style'd on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang-gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrt)
I pull up in that quarter milli' off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he bite a rock

Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki, like the Prince song

Ayy, yo, I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chun-Li' drop the Benz off
Oh, I get it
They paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well, it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me
I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them could've did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, ""She really is the best""
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest

Oooh
If I took you home it'd be a home run
Show me how you do

Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it
Glass to the roof

Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Oooh-ooohh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check one two-oooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto

More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

I shoulda figured though
All that shit you was spittin'
So unoriginal
But it was you
So I was with it
And tell you the truth
Wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do
Stick to the business
But you came out the blue
And then you just flipped it
Goddamn baby
My mind's blown
Be forgettin'
You live in a different time zone
Think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
Yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
This is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same
And though I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (oh)

2016,Stressed Out,twenty one pilots,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time

When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out

We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying
""Wake up, you need to make money"", yeah

2014,V. 3005,Childish Gambino,"No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hold up
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays with young lavishes
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans, they took from the cabinet (whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (hol' up)

Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogaine
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

2017,First Day Out,Tee Grizzley,"These niggas prayed on my downfall
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Lets keep this water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Being broke did something to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, driving German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, remember I used to use your L's to hit the road
Hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, remember when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals trying not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothing, I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers coming in and out of court
Aye Dwan though, aye Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Aye JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro kill me if I snitch, cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill you
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas hoe me? Quit being silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
Cause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga""
So let me know what you can handle, okay come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancing, eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders (boom boom boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? aye I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoeing niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies
Boy I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was coming home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on
Get em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white, that paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm two and oh
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

2015,Blank Space,Taylor Swift,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, hmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, hmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers

And you love the game

Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark

All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,

Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you move it
Now take it in but don't look down

Try to take the easy way out

And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans

And take her on a first date again

2015,Hood Go Crazy,Tech N9Ne Featuring 2 Chainz & B.o.B,"Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one so i'ts guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kansas City natives and we all a little coo-coo
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in, then dip off
Look for another chick, then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross
Three thick friends, we mixin' these licks when
They big friend wanna lip off
So I told her come and get lost, bitch
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche photo white
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her
I'm trynna knock up, I'm trynna put a singer in her
So I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender
Thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Trynna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, ""don't mess around with them pitbulls.""
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy

Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'yac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up
This Kansas City, shit's ran gritty
In the summer time, the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Errbody got they hands up like (Oooh!)
See a bad bitch like (Wooah!)

A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tenneesse
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank god I was an optimist
I drove circles around this town
Tryin' to write circles around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
So many times, I thought about leavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Everybody else is ones who got away
I'm around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church

So tell me, what you waitin' for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever
There's no regretting anymore
It's worth to wait, even so far away
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No light to break when you're hangin' by fate
You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind
All alone just the beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive...
Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you can't deny that you're living
Open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after
All alone just the beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled

2016,I Hate U I Love U,gnash Featuring Olivia O'Brien,"Feeling used, but I'm still missing you
And I can't see the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
What about all the times
You would pick me up and we'd just drive
Around until we found a place to stay and waste the day away
We'd do nothing but it was okay with me
You say it's not good to spend all my time
Thinking about you so late at night
But I can't stop once I start it's like an avalanche
Thoughts coming and I just wanna hold your hand
Hold your breath, I'm going under
Not coming up 'til this night is over
Until this night is over
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you ever see
How is it you never notice that you are slowly killing me
I hate you, I love you

2017,Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart

2016,"Huntin', Fishin' And Lovin' Every Day",Luke Bryan,"Woah, woah, mmm
If I could make a livin' walkin' in the woods
You could bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in
A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin' and late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
I'd get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I back it up
And pullin' the string on a nine point nine two stroke
Murphy
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And we'd get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

I'm gettin' red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that dirty air
I'll be down here knee deep in the Muckalee
Huntin', Fishin', Lovin' everyday
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
And lets go there in our minds
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin' and dark whiskey in the evenin'

And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want

I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
Say ""fuck y'all"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it Cudi

2016,Wasted Time,Keith Urban,"The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back
To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good
When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time
All that wasted time
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the greed and the game
But I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good
When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time
All that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all
When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time
All that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line

2017,Hometown Girl,Josh Turner,"She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

She don't like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands gotta blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it's Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith

2014,Bartender,Lady Antebellum,"8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender
Pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I'll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender
Pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
I'm feeling that buzz
I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh ooh
Oh oh oh, what I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around

You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say it's not that hard
But I just got a feelin'
This'll leave an ugly scar
If you say she's nothing to worry about
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
Stupid boy makin' me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?

One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be

You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then, I'll just be someone

2017,Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing

I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
I've broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door (at my door)
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I change
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (to walk away)
When I was getting crazy, reckless and wild
Acting like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (find its place)

But without here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die
'Til the day I die
Funny how we both end happy but everything seems alright, ooh
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, just what do you think could ever take you off my mind
I'll never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die
Doing it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you
Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you
I'll never forget you
And you'll always be by my side

2022,Fall In Love,Bailey Zimmerman,"Heard you moved out to South Carolina
Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye
I heard you found yourself a brand new man
Put a rock on your finger
And he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful
But baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Well money talks, but I ain't buying
'Cause love's a smoke ring
Wrapped around your finger
One second it's a blessing
And the next it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walking testimony
My confession is a lesson
That I'm pouring out in this song
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa
You don't wanna fall in love
I seen your mama walking out the county market
And I thought to ask her how she's been
She said she's missing ya
And tried to go convincing ya
Not to settle down with him
She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it
You had a bed of roses
But girl, you couldn't walk that line
You can act like you're doin' fine
'Cause love's a smoke ring
Wrapped around your finger
One second it's a blessing
And the next it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walking testimony
My confession is a lesson
That I'm pouring out in this song

2012,Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),Kelly Clarkson,"You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want
You think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
But told you I was moving on over you
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me but you see what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me
You know in the end the day to left was just my beginning

2021,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like, ""One day, you'll come back to me""
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head

You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different, got me looking stupid (damn)
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

2020,Emotionally Scarred,Lil Baby,"A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew?
Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden

You moved to west L.A., or New York or Santa Fe

Oh, but that one night, was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you

Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again

2015,I Don't Get Tired (#IDGT),Kevin Gates Featuring August Alsina,"I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said ""Grind a little harder""
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Gun in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
Me and the woman I love on an air mattress
We share a cot, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Stale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them ""Get lost""
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with
Shorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash
I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents

It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas

Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig

Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub
I started this wave, and ain't usin' a brush
Stopped taking molly, now I'm back on the E
Flyin' commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving the spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt

2015,Planez,Jeremih Featuring J. Cole,"Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk, no
I could put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read ""The World Is Yours""
On a blimp?
Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you thirty thousand feet
On your knees, in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
Get high, baby, roll one, cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feeling, the turbulence, girl, when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
Ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better
If I hit the west coast?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now

You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big, it's like a foot is in yo' mouth
And you ain't babysitting, but my kids all on yo' couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in a low tide?
Deebo-ed your bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So God damn, don't make me beg

Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, making those tan lines
It's like the ocean knows we're laying
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waiting
For you to come alive 'cause
You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down, made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita salt water sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl your touch is a hundred degrees
Boardwalks were made for dancing
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And girl I was made for you like

2013,Brave,Sara Bareilles,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out

2020,Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life

More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnight's and I love you's
Me and you baby, walk in the footsteps

Ten little toes, a painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we'll build this love from the ground up

And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll build this love from the ground up

And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by
In the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
The cloud are gonna roll
The earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain
And we'll build this love from the ground up

Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

With thousands of pictures

Gave you a million reasons girl not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you, yeah, yeah

She's got the bar in the palm of her hand

I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her

Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah

In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the hey I think we need to talk
And the it ain't me it's you's
And here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sittin' here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

You goin' crazy
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with mohawk
Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off
I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish
Turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin'
Because I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is
""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be
This shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin'
So he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in
So I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me
I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim
I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done
What you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air
Only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck
And I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check
It ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go
We only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle
City nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo
This is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit
Could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix
I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money
This ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide
I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good
I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
I'm just tryna ball and live,
Hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills

Overbuying cars

Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow
We in a new location
Free all of the guys
I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house
Four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living
I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft
I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don
Might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch
Why the fuck would you say that?
You can do it first
I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back
Never take it personal, show no mercy
Bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught
""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house
You can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me
No problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you
I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old
I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom
So the trenches is where I feel safe at

2013,Maybe It Was Memphis,Danielle Bradbery,"Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree
What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away
What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis

But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis

Every night now since I've been back home
Lie awake drifting in the memory

Talking that way so soft to me

You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya?
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya

You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal

Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""Ya'll Come Back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
Oh, it ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

Swing my heart across the line

Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Oh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be

Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?

2017,Castle On The Hill,Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it (I'm the poplar trees)
So let's get on with it
We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya'
Before the limelight stole ya'
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happening
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas

To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with BeyoncÃ©, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie
'Til death but do your part, unholy matrimony
Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze, breeze

That summer night holding long and long, 'din long
No waiting for the summer rose and (breathe)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn

And living and living like I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
And living all I have

A salt and a Buffett song?""

2020,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,"Protests and growing national outcry continues
Over the death of George Floyd
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
Trade my 4 x 4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again
I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead
But still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us
Then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life

This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit
Told her don't let her friends know
In the 'Ville and I move like a don
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?""
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram
I can't switch on the fam
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan
This where my head is
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin'
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent

2020,Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get luck
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I will never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
There's a worn-out blade that my Granddaddy gave me
My Mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve

A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
'Cause it's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much, but it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much, but it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain
Every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well, every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart

I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I 'wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

And I realize
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for

And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities

And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again a island lullaby
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion, stop on by and play a while
Simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by
And jump right in

Glock with a switch, two of those when I ride through the city (when we ride)
And we thought a nigga died, but he didn't (but he died)

(Ten and up if you dyin' in Philly)

Anythin' close to a dub
And a youngin'll walk for a hundred, he down to get caught
Long as I send him the items, consider it bought
I call the shots, I'm the boss
I'm ridin' with a semi
Two of them, I can't die in my city
Do a shootin', it ain't gotta be pretty
Catch him out, and we handle the business
I ain't gettin' in no nigga business
Thirty million, my mind in the trenches still
Fuck her good, make her nigga not turn her on
They got brodie on camera, he comin' home
Run it up from a scale to a microphone
Treat Dior like a muhfuckin' Nike store
And you know he ain't that, why you hype him up?
Any time we have smoke, it just pipe me up
Never know the outcome 'til you try your luck
Get whatever you want when I'm tryna fuck
And we chillin', nobody can't fuck with us
Put the four in the P with the fuckin' M
I should never bring the pain on my fuckin' self
Really need it if I ever ask for help
I just know I'ma blow if it's life or death
I made all them hoes who ain't never left

Pretty soon you'll be changin' the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
Heavy into everything
Ready for the next thing
Catch a ride for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shines gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but
Woah oh woah oh
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah oh woah oh
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me
You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that
Woah oh woah oh
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah oh woah oh

Woah oh woah oh
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands

This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for

So when them big boys want all of that
Tell the bartender, say my order back
It's bottle service, he ordered that
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose
I never worry, life is a journey

Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two

Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Keep a Drac' like I started up OVO
You can get a percent, but I want the most
Got a house with a lake, so I bought a boat
'Bout to switch up a play, that's an audible
State-to-state, private jet with some model hoes
Had to run up more dollars than followers
Me and bae take the week off in Cabo
Life's a gamble, I'm playin' the lotto
I'm bettin' it all 'cause I know that I got 'em
'Member me? I was drivin' Impalas
We don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it
I remember that D2 revolver I bought for my partna, he died in a argument
They was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em
'Member askin' my mom where my father been at
Ain't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at
Niggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had
Get them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag
Say he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can
Hop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band
I come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand
Twenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan
I got horny, almost fucked on a fan
I had to think about it, I can't end up on Shade Room
Everything that I hit, I done paid for
She know what I can bring to the table
I can tell if it's real by the label
We had TV, but we didn't have cable
Now I'm richer than all of my neighbors
I wear my chain proud, it's a trophy

You ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me

Bitch, I'm a D-boy, do it for T.Roy
I'm on you forever, that's just word to V.Roy
I'm with the killers forever, the trenches is in me
The Grammys can't change me for nothin'
I like the bitches who let me just offer them cash
You never gon' ask me for nothin', never gon' switch
Only time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button
Rappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'
That's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'

But Four Pockets Full, but we keep it a hundred

It only feel like I've been rappin' a year
Let a nigga play with me, I'm ready

Lights off, I couldn't see my belly

2020,One Big Country Song,LOCASH,"Yeah, life is like a jukebox, just push play
Not everybody's first verse sounds the same
But we all get born and we all get raised
Whether it's some boondocks or Marina Del Rey
Everybody turns wild when you're sixteen
Slow roll, big timin' on main street
Everybody's got holes in their blue jeans
If you bought 'em that way or not
Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars

And who ain't ever tasted better cookin' than their mother? (Not me)
Who ain't got a story to tell?
And who ain't made it through some hell?
Who don't love somebody, don't miss somebody?

Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything

I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the twenties up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo

2015,Blessings,Big Sean Featuring Drake,"Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight up, look)
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
'Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up 'cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

2016,Came Here To Forget,Blake Shelton,"Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Yeah, first of all we came here to forget
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over

Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house

Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

2018,I Lived It,Blake Shelton,"Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found the hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Momma poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand where
The yellow jacket's torn me up
And I ain't making this up
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them old Duke boys, they're flattening their heels
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawnmower 'round
I go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it

Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's? Not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that block-ow
Dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet
It's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas
Don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I'm takin' pictures
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I'm with ya

She think I'm the realest out
And I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us.""
Aww, that look like what's her name
Chances are it's what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like
So one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full
So I'm extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don't talk shit, we just state facts, yes, Lord

Lil' CC on the beat, mm
Yeah, yeah
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave ya
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave
Couple figures, killers call and collect (collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a Mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (get it)
Go getter, half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (no limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yay
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (bounce)
Gotta count up my allowance (gotta count up my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (so I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (about it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (house)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

There's nothing you can ever hide
Already got the screenshots

But you steady choosing
Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
But that ain't been keeping us stable
So I guess I know what I gotta do

How would you like it if I do the things you do
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue

Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'?
Why dish it out but can't take it?
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him

How could you play me when the love I gave was real?
I even took you back and you still had no chill (no)

Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raisin'
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well, now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
They keep askin' how I am
But they're really askin' where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missin' all of the times
We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well, now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back

Hey lil' mama would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me 10 times 3
30, 000 dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit RodÃ©o and I spent like 10 Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like 10 phones, damn I'm really never home
All these niggas clones tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Weight tip the scale, boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin' boy I'm making plays
50 shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if I ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the 6 throwing bows
I'm a real young nigga from the 6 throwing bows
Real young nigga from the 6 throwing bows
In the middle of the party bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rolling up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
Said that I can get that pussy easily
Said that I can hit that shit so greasily

I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I just sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettuchini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was 5 or 6 years old when I had told myself ok you're special
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was 26 years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world stepping
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party getting lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie word to my mami
In the middle of the party bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rolling up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli

Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits

I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top
Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods

Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back but
Imma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent

Then I play it back on the eighty-inch plasma

Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down

Drop it down low, crank up the throttle

Oh, I can hear em singing

Old enough to get there but to young to get inside
So i would stand out on the sidewalk

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
You gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure

And you loved me
A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it

They don't mean a thing

To count those rings

A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter

You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been draggin' your feet
Ain't it funny how I can't seem to get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good, it's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind

Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is
Noise
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise
Twenty-four hour television, get so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothing left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop
This noise
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise
Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make

Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you aint a ten you're a nine point nine
Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God all mighty

Oh wo-oh, oh wo-oh
We share something so common
But still so rare, and I'm in awe
Never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls
Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (turn the lights on)
Oh wo-oh, never-never, never knew love
Oh wo-oh, would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most, ooh
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close, ooh
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
Ooh, and it's killing me

'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (turn the lights on)
Oh wo-oh, never-never, never knew love
Oh wo-oh, would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
And it hurts
'Cause I wanna leave, and you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep, can't think about giving it up, ooh

2018,Yes Indeed,Lil Baby & Drake,"Yeah
Wheezy out of here
The dash, a digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: ""Yes, indeed""
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
$2, 500 for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngin's come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jew, he like his voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm Lil Baby
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: ""Yes, indeed""
Me and my dawgs goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

2014,Afire Love,Ed Sheeran,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them
And my father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
My father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah

NLE motherfuckin' Choppa
The Top Shotta, you hear me?
I stand on top of shit
We doin' this shit, ayy (go get him, go)
I whip the pack like Ike and Tina, I just copped me a Bimmer (a Bimmer)
Used to ride in steamers (steamer), I'm hot as jalapeÃ±os
Bitch, I'm sellin' out arenas (I'm sellin' 'em out)
They say, ""He entertain us"" (entertain)
And if you try to tame us, I bet we leave you stained up (ayy)
Whole lotta sticks in the house, it's a gun show
Bullets get him wet like a motherfuckin' poncho
I'on think none of y'all niggas want gun smoke
Don't second guess this shit, I'm gon' blow (pussy)
Whole lotta shots when it come out the Drac'
Chop a nigga up, then put him in the lake (brrt)
Shiesty young nigga, they call me a snake
Ayy, fuck all that, Trick, shoot 'em in the face
Send a hit at five, he was dead by six (by six)
Got shot seven times, but the eighth shot missed
Nine shots in the clip, could've sworn it was ten
Didn't fuck with 12, I was 11 again
I need me a trophy, the best to sin
You niggas ain't straight, y'all lesbians
And fuck your dead homie, I'll say it again
If he come back to life, he dead again
Try to fight me, he gon' fight for his life (bitch)
Swing with what? I'ma swing with the pipe
(He's not cherishin' it), ayy, take his life
Straitjacket music, I belong in asylum
Felonies and felonies, this what they keep on sellin' me (yeah, yeah)
This recipe is deadly, see, I be drippin' like relish be (ayy, ayy)
Shoot him in the head, shoulda had on a hard hat (ayy)
We finish the beef as soon as you start that (ayy)
Bitch, I shoot first, why the fuck would I spark back?
If you really a thug, let me see where your heart at (ayy)
If I say catch a body, lil' nigga, you catchin' it?
If I tell you run off, is you really finessin' it? (Ayy)
If I give you a brick, are you gon' sell that shit? (Ayy)
If you get in a jam, are you gon' start tellin' shit?
Where is the smoke? 'Cause bitch, I'm inhalin' it
Just like the army, we got some artillery
Can they free my dawgs? I'm being sincerely
'Nother 'opp died, a nigga like, ""Seriously?"" (damn, another one?)
Nigga, we shot him, and then we killed his brother, damn
We might as well get the mother
Nigga say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em
If my brothers don't like him, I don't
Somebody tell him he in trouble
I paid too much for my motherfuckin' guns for me to scuffle
Gangster young nigga, I feel like Gucci (Gucci)
Fucked her so hard, left blood on her coochie
Made her said, ""Ooh"" put my thumb in her booty
I'll be damned, this dumb ass hoe just pooted
Who ain't with the murder? Lil' nigga, I kill
That night he died, that was my idea
Told my niggas slide, make sure he don't live
But that's a lil' secret, just keep it concealed
My metal a MAC and I bet I attack
It's a hundred, some shots in this gat, so get back
He thought I was lyin', that shit was a fact
Got shot in his spine, but you watchin' his back
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?, haha
(Strait, straitjacket music, I belong in asylum)
Fuck a nigga, what a nigga, fuck a nigga mean?

Is energy I can live without

Get her out dem tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bitch
I'm the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes
But I'm looking for a cute bitch

When I ain't around
Give a damn who you do it with

2017,If I Told You,Darius Rucker,"What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
Cause everybody has already tried
Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em
So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no
Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?

Bow your head, they're pious here

Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in-crowd

I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found,
I lost hope that I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along
And I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me, getting me through the night

2019,Middle Child,J. Cole,"You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck

Wind up in the mirror just to see yourself

Why should I fake it anymore?
If I firm the ting and work that, can you take it anymore?
This time I have left cannot be wasted anymore
You realize it now and you miss it
Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it?
Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in the house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago
I moved on so long ago
You're still thinkin' 'bout me, though, oh
I'm still tryna make sense of it all
You're still sayin' things to keep me involved
Supposed to let me know how you feel, now what to do?
It shouldn't take a text from me to speak your truth
Rough
You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
But this might be too much for me

Well, don't wanna make something from nothing, that's where I be
Well, keep getting nothing for something, how's that fair to me?
I'm thinking something for something, that's what I need
I'm too behind in a race to rush for my lead
I'm not rushing you, trust me, I'm
I'm the last person that needs to rush anything, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing
It's clear that we all get lonely, then you call me
All I needed from you was to
Hold me down when things aren't working
For some reason, I believed in you, oh
Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it?
Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in the house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago
So long ago
I can't even remember when we lost each other
Was it last year, this year, or some other?
Been so long since you said things that cover up the lies
We can do it this time
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Your favorite thing to say, ""We can do it this time""
Just have some faith, we can do it this time

Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
AsÃ­ mismo me engaÃ±aste

CÃ³mo tratas de buscarme
DespuÃ©s que tÃº me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme

Why, oh why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay
Uh, I don't know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level's no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain't even bedtime
And don't you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain't the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just wanna see you happy
I just wanna see you laughing
I just wanna see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; Â¡wuh!)

Having conversations about my haste decisions
Fucking sickening

Life is only thing we need
They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave

Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't stress about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubble, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bust down everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)

Fuck it, I'm makin' 'em pay

And like the third Migo, I take

'Set out here havin' his way
Qua' out here havin' his way
And like the third Migo, I take
(What? Ayy, yeah)
Now that I'm pickin' it through
I just ain't fell in love 'cause I'm way too awake
And she tried fuckin' a rapper to break up my heart
But my heart doesn't break
Soon as I link with these niggas
They feelings are written all over they face (what?)
Okay, great, I'm in the backroom of Wally's
I spent thirty thousand on somebody's grapes
We done did so many pull ups on niggas
No wonder we gettin' in shape
Too busy backin' my words up with actions
To ever go front in your face (what? Ayy)
Shit done changed, billionaires talk to me different
When they see my paystub from Lucian Grainge
Told myself that I would get through this verse
And I'm not gonna mention the plane
But look at the plane, the fuck are we sayin'? (Yeah, what?)
Fuck are we sayin'?
Big '81, but I don't own a Harley I ride in Mercedes with Shane (ayy)
It's me and Lil' Harley, we wreckin' this shit
Then we 'bout to go link with the gang (ayy)
And unlike that clock on the wall at your mama house
I do not have time to hang
Please don't reach out to me
Think watchin' too much of Stephen done got to me
Verses too eas', I'm servin' up by the threes
I'm playin' pool and the pool just connects to the beach
I've been too solid to ever have stripes on my sneaks, you get what I mean?
Back in the day, my dawgs was puttin' eight balls
In the pockets of all of the fiends, and- (what? What?)
That was back in the day
Now we involved in legitimate business, baby, we came a long way
Sometimes I hop on the road by myself, and I listen to shit that you say
All of y'all havin' more followers than dollars
And that's why I cannot relate (ayy, no, what?)
Load up the Drac'
What else are they gonna play?

OVO scope on the Drac' (uh)
We havin' our way (havin' that shit)
Havin' my way in the city
Get pulled out your britches, you talkin' or trippin'?
Go put all my cleats on, walkin', ain't slippin' (walk)
Havin' my way, now this shit like a business
Load up the base, now I feel like Cal Ripken (ayy)
She had it her way, now she out of a Bentley (skrrt)
(Skrrt-skrrt, get out, ooh)
Fuck how you take it, we straight from the vacant (hey)
I caught me some cases, then beat it, then raced it (hey)
Seen they was hatin', no communication
No invitation, cut off circulation (no)
Blue or the red Bugatti, this the matrix
Crosses all on my body, watch for Satan (Chrome)
I'm havin', Gallery, Lanvin
No talkin', we smashin' (smash)
This one a classic, ain't none of this average (classic)
Sniper, I'm snipin' the bitch, I'm assassin (snipe)
I piped her, then piped the bitch up for some action (hey)
I don't even be braggin', these lil' niggas maggots (maggots)

I was seventeen on a song with Drake
It's like an eviction notice when we droppin' (get out)
'Cause niggas get moved out they space (move)
Two and a half, was goin' on three
But fuck it 'cause it's worth the wait (fuck it)
Not to be ignorant, but I want everything that's on the menu
And what's on your plate (gimme that)
I talk to God, he give me the faith (God)
I hit The Boy if I need me a Drac' (brrt)
I got a Richie that sit on my left (Mille)
But somehow, I always be pullin' up late (how?)
Ain't been on earth (no)
Ever since I copped that rocket chain and took a trip outer space (go)
Ever since birth, my mama told me (mama)
That they gon' act cool, but they really hate (hate)
I know my worth (worth)
So you ain't gettin' no verse if you talkin' 'bout a lil' K (nah)

2020,Snow On Tha Bluff,J. Cole,"Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead?
When you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveying you holier, come help get us up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet, "" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on Tha Bluff?
Well maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doing enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryna let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes

Ooh, BigHead on the beat
Young nigga shit
Bitch, gang, gang, gang, gang, hrrr
38 Baby
Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to heaven, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck you, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' the gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it

A dime and a nine, it was mine every week

A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party

I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6

2021,Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"I quit huntin' with my daddy
Guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer
Had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster
And as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Huh
I spent way less time in Nashville
And more time in L.A.
My back home buddies, they quit callin'
Thought I had too much on my plate
But last night we cracked some cold beers
And cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Yeah, I love me some California
But it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado
Didn't need no four by four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet
They didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on
They've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again
Oh
Yeah, I love me some California
But it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded sunsets with my wife
For hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her
I still wasn't really home
But last night we built a fire
Watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Man, it feels good to be country again

2016,Lost Boy,Ruth B,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even, sometimes, he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, Lost Boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together, we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, Lost Boy"", they say to me

From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best
And I know I'm all over the road

When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""it'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines
Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go

Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go
And I know I'm all over the road

2013,Bad,Wale Featuring Tiara Thomas Or Rihanna,"Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend for what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad no)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Let me tell you about, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

2017,No Such Thing As A Broken Heart,Old Dominion,"I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up
How did my mom and my dad ever do it
If there were troubles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other and that was enough
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try,
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat you love like
You're jumping off a rope swing maybe 'cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep that chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's what's up

2020,After A Few,Travis Denning,"I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs

Swag as cold as sickness
Teen Driicky tatted on 'em cause they're a** is so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi
Man they can't control the pictures
M-O-B tat, screaming money over b****es

Something that you ain't accustom to
Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up, like the train back in the eighties
I've been through the test
Now, ink on my chest
Trying to triple my chest
I spit through the rest

Can't be near us close to lethal

Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer-up for the people

2015,Photograph,Ed Sheeran,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

2013,Crash My Party,Luke Bryan,"It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind telling all the guys ""I can't meet 'em"".
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh I just gotta see what you're wearing.
Your hair, is I put up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.
If you wanna call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me.
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And I'm gone so long, hang on. I'll meet you in a minute or two.
If you wanna call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door's unlocked. I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
If it's 2 in the morning and you're feeling lonely and wondering what I'm doing.
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
