# **Deep Learning Project**

This project attempts to use different approaches, namely zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning applied with a GTP model, as well as a regular application of a RNN and a NLTK model, to analyze a dataset of song lyrics and identify their associated sentiment. By utilizing these different models and approaches we intend to compare the levels of accuracy produced by each and determine which is more appropriate to the given problem and what improvements could be made.
